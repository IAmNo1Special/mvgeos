"""Retry policy for Realm calls.

Two layers, mirroring Pi:

- `retry_realm_request` retries a single HTTP request against a Realm. It honours
  server-supplied `Retry-After` headers and backs off with capped, jittered
  exponential delay.
- `retry_invocation` retries a whole Invocation. Realms report transient trouble
  as a `RealmResponse` carrying an error rather than raising, so this layer
  classifies the response instead of catching exceptions.

Both take an optional `signal` (AbortSignal). When aborted, retry loops exit
promptly by raising AbortError.
