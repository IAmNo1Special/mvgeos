"""Approval Rune contract types for the CLI host adapter.

Source of truth: ``~/workspace/your_files/approval-rune-spec/approval-rune-spec.pdf``
(Host-behavior and Interaction-design sections).

The engine owns the canonical gate vocabulary in ``mvgeos_core.approval``
(``ApprovalRequest`` / ``ApprovalDecision`` / ``ApprovalPresenter`` and the
outcome/scope/reason-code enums); this module re-exports it and adds the
CLI-only pieces:

* ``ApprovalMode`` — the one-run ``--approval-mode`` flag. Never persisted;
  environment variables never select it.
* ``ApprovalBindingError`` — raised when the presenter cannot be bound.
* ``PersistentGrantInfo`` — the CLI's display model for the persistent-grant
  confirmation screen, derived from the canonical request. The engine's
  request carries no grant metadata (the rune owns policy); the presenter
  describes the grant from the engine-derived spell identity and the
  current cast's arguments.
