"""Host-side bind/unbind adapter for the Approval Rune presenter slot.

Canonical engine slot shape (``RuneRunner`` in ``mvgeos_runes``; this
adapter duck-types against it)::

    runner.set_approval_presenter(presenter) -> None
    runner.clear_approval_presenter() -> None

where ``presenter`` satisfies ``mvgeos_core.approval.ApprovalPresenter``
(``await presenter(request)``). Binding is host-privileged: only the host
(CLI/GUI) calls the setter. It is never exposed through ``RuneAPI`` —
otherwise any rune could install an auto-approver. With no presenter
bound, the rune's ``request_approval`` denies (fail closed).

Also carries the one-run ``--approval-mode`` helpers: the flag is never
persisted, and a warning prints before channeling begins whenever it is
explicitly set to a non-deny value. Environment variables never grant
approval and are not consulted here.
