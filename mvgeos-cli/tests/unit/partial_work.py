"""Unit tests for the partial-work report printed on a non-zero exit.

A run that fails after spells have written leaves the Summoner's work on disk
and the process exit non-zero. These tests pin the two reports that must come
out of that path -- name the files, or say plainly that nothing ran -- and the
silence a clean run keeps.

The agent's ``run`` appends to its own transcript before raising, because that
is the order the engine produces: the harness reduces each ``MESSAGE_END`` into
the state as the turn goes, and only then does the next turn's upstream error
raise.
