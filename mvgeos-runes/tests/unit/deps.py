"""Unit tests for mvgeos_runes.deps python-dependency installation.

Two defects motivated this module. The rune installer shelled out to a
bare ``uv add``, which resolves against the *current working directory*,
so installing a rune rewrote the pyproject.toml and uv.lock of whatever
project the user happened to be standing in. It also swallowed every
error, so a failed dependency install was indistinguishable from success.

Runes run in-process against module-level registries owned by the host,
following the same constraint Pi and DeepSeek's harness both settled on:
one shared, host-singleton dependency tree. A per-rune virtualenv would
give a rune a private copy of the host packages and silently register
into a registry the agent loop never reads. So there is exactly one
environment, owned by the extensions directory, and the loader already
discovers it.
