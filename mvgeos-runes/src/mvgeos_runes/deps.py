"""Python-dependency installation for installed extensions.

Runes are loaded in-process and mutate registries the host owns -- the
realm registry, the rune runner. Both Pi and DeepSeek's harness settled
on the same constraint for their extensions: one shared, host-singleton
dependency tree, because an extension that resolves its own private copy
of a host package registers into a module-level registry the agent loop
never reads. That failure is silent, and it is why this project does not
give each rune its own virtualenv.

So there is exactly one environment, owned by the extensions directory.
``mvgeos_runes.loader.discover_rune_site_packages`` already walks each
rune's parent directories looking for a ``.venv``, which means this
environment needs no loader changes to be found.

The environment has its own project manifest, mirroring the single
generated manifest per install root that Pi maintains for its
extensions. Dependencies therefore never land in the pyproject.toml or
uv.lock of whatever project the user happened to invoke the CLI from.
