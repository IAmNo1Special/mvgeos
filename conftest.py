"""Session-wide hermeticity guards for the workspace test suite.

TESTING.md section 2 forbids real secrets and credential-bearing
environment variables in tests. Two mechanisms defeated that:

``Mvge.__init__`` calls ``load_dotenv()`` on the caller's ``.env``, and
``load_dotenv`` writes into the process-wide ``os.environ`` without ever
rolling back. The lookup is caller-frame relative, so a test cannot
reliably steer it away from the repository's own ``.env`` -- which holds
real credentials. Whichever test constructed an agent first therefore
handed the developer's API keys to every test that ran after it.

The guard below restores the credential variables after each test. It is
deliberately scoped to those variables rather than the whole environment:
the auto-loading behaviour is exercised on purpose by
``test_dot_env_auto_loading``, and a blanket rollback would also revert
unrelated writes that background watcher threads may still be reading.

    ``skill_evolution`` were installed globally. The suite was green or red
