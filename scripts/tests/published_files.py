"""Tests for the partial-publish resume helper.

`scripts/published_files.py` decides which built files still need uploading after
a release failed partway. That decision is load-bearing in the worst possible
direction: a file reported as missing when it is already published is uploaded
into an immutable version and fails, and a file reported as present when it is
missing is silently skipped, leaving the index half-written and the run green.

The HTTP call is mocked. What is under test is the decision made from the
answer, including the answer that could not be obtained -- the case that most
easily becomes a silent skip.
