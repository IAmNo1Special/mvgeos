"""Tests that the Python embedded in workflow heredocs is valid Python.

This exists because of a measured failure. On 2026-10-10 #212 shipped a `bump`
job that could not run:

```
File "<stdin>", line 12
    updated, count = pattern.subn(...)
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

Three things made that reach main. The edit was made inside a GitHub Actions
`run:` block, so it was YAML-valid. `release-tooling` runs `tests/`, and
nothing compiled the Python that YAML is only a container for. And the job that
died from it ran only on pushes to main, so the first place the failure was
visible was a red run on main, after the merge.

The lesson generalises past heredocs: a workflow file is not just YAML, it is
YAML with programs inside it, and only the YAML half was being checked. These
tests read the workflows as data and compile the other half.

Note on extraction. A `run: |` block is a YAML literal scalar, so `yaml` hands
back the script with the block's indentation already removed -- which is exactly
what `bash` receives. A heredoc opened with `<<'PY'` therefore closes on a line
that is `PY` at column zero of that returned string. Getting this wrong is how
the first draft of this file "passed" while checking nothing: it kept prose
from the surrounding script and compiled a body that never existed on the
runner.
