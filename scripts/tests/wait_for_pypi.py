"""Tests for the release-readiness wait.

`scripts/wait_for_pypi.py` stands between an upload and the jobs that claim the
release is installable. What is under test is every judgement it makes from what
the index said, because each of those can be wrong in a direction that produces
a confident wrong answer:

* a version that is not on the index reported as present, which is the vacuous
  check that ran on v0.6.19 -- `/pypi/mvgeos//json` is 200 for every package
  that has ever existed;
* an index that could not be reached reported as absent, which sends the reader
  hunting for an upload problem that does not exist;
* a wait that spins forever rather than failing, which occupies the runner until
  the job timeout and reports nothing;
* a `uvx` command that differs from the one a stranger types, so the wait proves
  something other than installability.

The HTTP call and the `uvx` call are mocked. Nothing here talks to PyPI.
