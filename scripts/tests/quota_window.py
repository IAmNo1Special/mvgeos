"""Tests for the PyPI new-project quota window helper.

`scripts/pypi_new_project_window.py` exists to answer one question: a `429 Too
many new projects created` is a full account quota, not a broken distribution,
and the only useful thing to say about it is when to come back. Everything here
protects that arithmetic, because the whole reason the script exists is that
reading the quota as a daily reset turns one day into four and sends somebody
chasing a limit request that was never needed.

The HTTP call itself is mocked. The pure decision -- which creation ages out
first, and how many windows the remaining names need -- is the part that can be
wrong while still producing a confident-looking report, so that is what is
under test.
