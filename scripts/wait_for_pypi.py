"""Wait for a release to reach the index before anything claims it is installable.

`publish.yml` uploads eight distributions and then, seconds later, two jobs ask
PyPI whether the release is there and whether a stranger can install it. Both
questions were being asked too early. On v0.6.19 the upload returned at
00:03:12Z and `verify-install`'s first command failed at 00:03:26Z:

```
[1/5] uvx mvgeos --help -> exit 1 in 0.14s
error: No solution found when resolving tool dependencies
  cause: Because there is no version of mvgeos==0.6.19 and you require
         mvgeos==0.6.19, we can conclude that your requirements are unsatisfiable.
```

The release had landed. The index had not caught up. Waiting is the whole of the
fix, and what to wait *for* is the part that is not obvious, because the obvious
answer is wrong in both directions.

``https://pypi.org/pypi/<name>/<version>/json`` answers **200 too early**. A
version-specific URL that has never been requested is not cached, so it is
served from origin: 200 the moment the release commits, while the cache purge
the upload triggers for the index ``uvx`` actually resolves against has not
propagated yet. ``uvx`` reads the simple index, and PyPI serves that from cache
-- measured on ``https://pypi.org/simple/mvgeos/`` as
``cache-control: max-age=600, public`` -- under a key warehouse purges on
upload (``warehouse/api/simple.py``, ``warehouse/cache/origin/__init__.py``). So
a 200 on the version URL does not mean the release is installable, and waiting
for it is waiting for something that has already happened.

The same URL answers **404 too long** afterwards. A 404 for a version that does
not exist yet is produced before the view runs, so it carries no cache key and
the upload's purge cannot invalidate it. ``published_files.py`` asks that exact
URL seconds *before* the upload in the publish job, which seeds the cache with a
404 that outlives the release it is about to become. Measured on
``https://pypi.org/pypi/mvgeos/0.6.99.json``: 404 from the Fastly cache on every
request for the whole of a six-minute observation window, ``x-cache: MISS,
HIT``, with no ``cache-control`` on the response to bound it.

So presence is read from ``https://pypi.org/pypi/<name>/json``, the project
document, which lists every release under ``releases`` and is cached under the
key the upload purges. It asks the same question -- is this version on the index
-- and it is fresh when the index is fresh, because warehouse purges
``project/<name>`` for the simple index and the project document together.

And the only question that settles the matter outright is the one a stranger's
machine asks, so ``--resolve`` waits for ``uvx`` itself to install the release
rather than for any URL.

Usage:
    python scripts/wait_for_pypi.py --version 0.6.25
    python scripts/wait_for_pypi.py --version 0.6.25 --resolve
    python scripts/wait_for_pypi.py --version 0.6.25 \\
        --package mvgeos --package mvgeos-gui --timeout 300

Prints one line per distribution and exits 0 when everything asked for has
arrived. Exits 1 when the timeout expires with something still absent, which is
the half-landed release the `verify` job exists to name. Exits 2 when the
version cannot be named, because a version that resolves to nothing turns every
question below into the vacuous one this script exists to stop: the URL
``/pypi/mvgeos//json`` is 200 for every package that has ever existed.

Stdlib only, for the same reason as the other release scripts: it stands
between a release and the index on a runner, under a bare ``python3``.
