"""Prove the published distribution is usable by someone who has never seen it.

`publish.yml` already runs `uvx mvgeos --help` from a checkout-free runner, which
proves the name resolves and the console script exists. It proves nothing about
whether the thing then *works*: a package whose Realm Rune is missing, whose
credential never loads, or whose Tome never reaches disk all sail past `--help`
and fail on a stranger's first real task. This harness runs that first real
task and asserts on the three things a Summoner would notice:

1. `uvx mvgeos --help` exits zero.
2. Every first-party distribution in the resolved tree is at the released
   version -- the seven that make up the runtime closure, none missing, none
   from a different release.
3. The task produces its artifact, byte for byte.
4. A session Tome lands in ``$HOME/.agents/sessions/`` naming the model that
   served it, and records the Spell that was cast.

Assertion 2 exists because of a measured failure. On 2026-10-09 a release
half-landed: six of eight distributions reached PyPI and the root ``mvgeos``
was refused, and ``mvgeos 0.6.16`` declares ``mvgeos-cli>=0.6.16``, so a
mixed-version tree still satisfied every constraint it was given. ``--help``
exited zero on it and the first real task completed. Nothing that existed at
the time could tell. A half-published release is now a loud failure instead of
a silent one.

"Cold" here is precise, and the distinction matters. The scratch ``HOME`` starts
empty apart from the credential, and the uv cache is a fresh directory, so the
measured install is a real download rather than a cache hit.

How isolated the run is depends on the host, and the report says which it got
rather than rounding up. On a host with ``bwrap`` the harness re-runs itself
inside a mount, process, and UTS namespace in which the repository and the
operator's own ``HOME`` do not exist at all -- and it proves that from inside,
because a sandbox nobody checked is a claim, not evidence. Without ``bwrap`` it
still runs against a scratch ``HOME``, which is a weaker thing, and says so.

Usage:
    python scripts/verify_install.py --version 0.6.14
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-... python scripts/verify_install.py --version 0.6.14

The credential is read from ``OPENROUTER_API_KEY`` and written into the scratch
``HOME`` the way a Summoner would, so the run exercises the real key-resolution
path rather than being handed ``--api-key``.
