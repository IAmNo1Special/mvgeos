"""Which built files PyPI does not have yet, for one package version.

`publish.yml` uploads eight distributions and stops at the first refusal, so a
release that fails partway leaves the index half-written and the only recovery is
to run the same tag again. Something has to decide what is still missing, and
that is this.

It was `uv publish --check-url`, and it does not work. uv compares the *hash* of
the rebuilt file against the published one and fails when they differ, which for
a wheel built by `setup-uv@v7` they usually do: the wheel embeds
``Generator: uv <version>`` in its ``WHEEL`` metadata, and setup-uv installs the
newest uv available, so the same commit rebuilt on a different day produces
different bytes. Measured on `v0.6.17`: the published
``mvgeos_core-0.6.17-py3-none-any.whl`` carries ``Generator: uv 0.12.24`` and a
rebuild of the identical commit carries a different version. Every other byte of
the wheel, including the entire package payload, is identical -- only that line
and the ``RECORD`` hash of it differ. uv refused with

    error: Local file and index file do not match for
    `mvgeos_core-0.6.17-py3-none-any.whl`

which is the resume mechanism refusing to resume.

PyPI versions are immutable, so the question is not "are these bytes the same"
but "is this filename already there". That is what this asks, per file, against
the JSON API. A version that exists with a file missing is possible -- an upload
that died between two files -- so the check is per file rather than per version,
and a version that is wholly absent reports every file as missing.

Usage:
    python scripts/published_files.py --package mvgeos --version 0.6.17 \\
        --dist-dir dist

Prints one filename per line for each file not yet on PyPI. Prints nothing and
exits 0 when everything has landed. Exits 1 on any failure to determine that,
rather than reporting a file as missing and letting the caller try to upload
something that is already there.

Stdlib only, for the same reason `verify_install.py` is: this runs between a
release and the index, and nothing that stands there should itself need
installing.
