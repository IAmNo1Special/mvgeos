"""Preflight gate for a release to PyPI.

Two jobs, one source of truth:

1. Derive the publish order from the workspace dependency graph, so a release
   uploads every package before the packages that import it. No hardcoded list
   to fall out of date when a package is added.
2. Refuse to ship wheels whose metadata cannot resolve on another machine.

The second job is the point. ``[tool.uv.sources]`` is a uv-only table that never
reaches a wheel; ``Requires-Dist`` is emitted verbatim from
``[project.dependencies]``. A workspace dependency written as a bare name
therefore ships as a bare name, which resolves against whatever version of the
sibling happens to be newest on PyPI. That is how a release becomes
uninstallable. This gate fails the release instead.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_publish.py --list          # print publish order
    python scripts/check_publish.py --dist-dir dist  # validate built wheels
    python scripts/check_publish.py --version 0.6.5  # also assert lockstep
