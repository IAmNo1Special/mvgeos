"""Re-measure the published MvgeOS scorecard so a sceptic can falsify it.

Scorecard v1 was measured by hand. This script is the measurement code. Every
number it prints is produced by one of the six measures below, and every measure
states the definition it uses so the reader can disagree with the definition
rather than with an unverifiable claim.

Run it with no arguments::

    uv run python scripts/scorecard.py

That measures every project and prints a table, exiting non-zero if a gate
regresses. Each project is a shallow clone (`--depth 1`, default branch)
cached under a temporary directory, with one exception: MvgeOS's own row is
measured from the checkout this script is run in, because a scorecard's own
row has to describe the code the reader is standing in. Pass `--clone-self` to
measure our published clone instead. Point any row at a local checkout with
`--project KEY=PATH`; every check except measure 5 runs without network.

THE SIX MEASURES AND THEIR EXACT DEFINITIONS
=============================================

1. Source and test LOC
   A counted file is any `.py`, `.ts` or `.tsx` file in the checkout. Every
   language is counted, for every project, and the two totals are summed.

   THIS CHANGES THE MEASURE, AND IT CHANGES IT IN OUR FAVOUR, SO READ THIS.

   Scorecard v1 counted one language per project. v1's hermes-agent row is its
   900,282 Python lines and ignores its 624,949 lines of TypeScript; v1's
   deepseek-harness row is its 478,874 TypeScript lines and ignores its 8,244
   lines of Python. Counting all languages therefore moves hermes-agent's ratio
   from 1.43 to 1.07, and with hermes-agent below 1.07 rather than above 1.43,
   MvgeOS moves from fifth to third of seven on test density.

   We count all languages anyway, for two reasons, and the reader should hold
   both against the paragraph above:

   a) It is the stated definition. The measure is specified as "any `.py`,
      `.ts` or `.tsx` file". Narrowing it to one language so the numbers match
      a hand-measured document makes the script a rubber stamp for that
      document, which is the opposite of what a reproducible benchmark is for.
      The correction goes in the document, not in the script.
   b) The one-language rule has no stated basis and is not self-consistent. It
      counts hermes-agent's Python and deepseek-harness's TypeScript, which is
      "whatever language the project's own tooling is written in", an inference
      a reader cannot check from the output. It also silently drops a third of
      hermes-agent's source lines from a measure about source lines.

   A reader who thinks the mixed ratio is the wrong measure should still have
   the information to disagree: the per-language breakdown of both totals is in
   the baseline snapshot, and a project that is not single-language has its
   split printed under the table. MvgeOS's own row is single-language, so this
   decision does not move our own ratio in either direction -- it moves our
   RANK, by pushing hermes-agent below us.

   A counted file is EXCLUDED when any directory component is one of
   `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `vendor`, `out`, `coverage`, `.next`,
   `target`, `__pycache__`, `.git`, `.venv`, `venv`, `.tox`, `.eggs` or
   `site-packages`. The last five are not in v1's list and have to be: the
   documented command creates `.venv/` in this repository before the script
   runs, and counting it reports MvgeOS as a million-line project.

   A counted file is TEST code when any directory component is one of `test`,
   `tests`, `__tests__`, `spec`, or the file name matches one of
   `test_*`, `*_test.py`, `*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx`, `*.spec.ts`,
   `*.spec.tsx`. Everything else is SOURCE code.

   Lines are `len(text.splitlines())` over the whole file: blank lines and
   comment lines included. This is the definition v1 used and it is what makes
   the mvgeos row reproduce exactly (38,971 / 57,545). A "physical lines"
   figure is not a statement about how much code exists; it is a reproducible
   one, which is the only thing a benchmark needs.

2. Type strictness
   For a Python project: `[tool.mypy] strict` from any `pyproject.toml` in
   the checkout. For a TypeScript project: `compilerOptions.strict` in the
   root `tsconfig.json`, following the `extends` chain until a config that
   sets it is found. A project's nearest ancestor wins, matching how `tsc`
   merges configs. Reported as `true`, `false` or `unset`. Never
   inferred, never carried over from a sibling config that does not set it.

   This measure exists because v1 got it wrong by reading each tsconfig in
   isolation: pi and deepseek-harness both set `strict: true` in a
   `tsconfig.base.json` that the root config extends. Following the chain is
   not a refinement, it is the definition.

3. Enforced coverage floor
   The `fail_under` or `fail-under` key in `pyproject.toml` (under
   `[tool.coverage.report]`, `[tool.coverage]`, or `[coverage:report]`),
   `setup.cfg`, `.coveragerc` or `tox.ini`. The script then looks for a CI
   job that runs a coverage reporter without disabling the floor, and reports
   that job's name. `none` means no floor was found.

   Known blind spot, stated rather than hidden: a project that enforces coverage
   through Codecov's `target:` or a vitest/jest threshold instead of a
   `fail_under` key is reported as `none`. None of the seven projects does
   this today.

4. Cross-extension runtime imports  (the gate)
   Only for projects that declare an extension root. Each direct subdirectory of
   that root is one extension. An extension owns the importable name of any
   `mvgeos_runes_*` directory it contains, or else its own directory name.

   Every runtime source file under the extension root is parsed with `ast`
   -- never with grep, because grep cannot tell an import from a string that
   mentions one, and cannot tell a runtime import from a comment. Test files
   and any directory component in the exclusion list are skipped. An absolute
   import whose first dotted segment is owned by a DIFFERENT extension is
   counted as a cross-extension runtime import.

   A file that will not parse is reported as a parse failure with its path, and
   a parse failure is a FAILURE. It is never reported as a passing zero. This
   is the failure mode that would let the gate lie: a Rune saved with a syntax
   error under a Python version this interpreter cannot parse would silently
   contribute zero imports and look like a clean boundary.

   THE GATE: for a gated project, any cross-extension runtime import or any
   parse failure exits non-zero. Only mvgeos is gated. hermes-agent has a
   cross-plugin import today and that is a measurement, not our regression; a
   peer's code cannot fail our build.

5. Installability  (needs network, `--online`)
   One HTTP GET per package name against the package's index:
   `https://pypi.org/pypi/<name>/json` or
   `https://registry.npmjs.org/<name>`. The HTTP status code is reported.
   404 means a stranger cannot install it. Without `--online` this column
   reads `skipped` and the exit code is unaffected.

6. Annotation coverage
   Per Python source file, over every `def` and `async def` in the file
   (methods included), ignoring `self` and `cls`:

   fully annotated (1.0)
       every function in the file has an annotation on every parameter and on
       its return;
   partially annotated (0.5)
       not fully, but at least one parameter or return annotation appears
       somewhere in the file;
   nothing (0.0)
       no annotations at all, or the file defines no functions.

   A file that defines no functions scores 0, which is the only non-absurd
   choice: scoring it 1 would report mvgeos at 100%, and excluding it from the
   denominator would do the same. This is a count of annotations present in
   source text. It is NOT a type-checker result and it is not a substitute for
   one. mypy strict passing is a different and stronger claim, reported
   separately by measure 2.

EXIT CODES
==========
0   no gate violation
1   a gate regressed: cross-extension import, parse failure, or a regression in
    a gated project's own row against the baseline snapshot
2   usage or environment error
