"""Architecture guard: every package's ``__all__`` is its real public API.

The marketplace clones this repository and imports engine internals from
``main``. When ``DEFAULT_TOME_DIR`` was removed in favour of the
``sessions_dir()`` resolver, ``pi-codec`` and ``session-search`` broke on
the marketplace's ``main`` with ten import errors, and nothing in this
repository noticed.

``__all__`` is the declaration that makes such a break visible ahead of
time. A symbol that is importable but undeclared can be renamed or
removed with no signal here, while a consumer is already relying on it --
``selfmod-bridge`` was importing ``AuditError``, which was reachable through
the package namespace but absent from ``__all__``. This test keeps the
declaration honest in both directions so the cross-repo contract check has
something authoritative to compare against.
