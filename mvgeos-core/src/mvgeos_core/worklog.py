"""Read back the work a run completed, from the transcript it already wrote.

A Spell writes to disk the moment it executes, not when the turn ends. When an
upstream error raises after a turn of casts, the files are already on disk and
the run still exits non-zero. Nothing in the error path looked, so a Summoner
retrying without checking could overwrite or duplicate work they had already
done.

Everything needed to answer "what already landed" is already in the transcript:
the assistant turn records each ``spell_cast`` block with its arguments, and the
dispatcher appends the matching ``SpellResultMessage``. This module reads those
two halves and joins them, so reporting costs no new persistence.

Which paths count as *written* is the engine's call, not the spell's: a spell
declared ``read_only`` only observed its path, and claiming a Summoner might
lose a file they never touched would be worse than staying silent.
