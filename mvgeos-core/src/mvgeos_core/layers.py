"""The one resolved layer stack for the ``.agents`` protocol.

This module is the only place a Rune search path is derived. Its docstring
names the failure it exists to prevent:

    the install path and the discovery path resolving differently is what
    allows a rune to install successfully and then load nowhere.

Two rules make that impossible rather than merely unlikely.

**One call.** Installation, discovery, the CLI's Rune command mount, and
the agent's rune loading all go through :func:`resolve_rune_layers`. There
is no second derivation to drift.

**Scope is derived, never inferred.** :class:`Scope` is a *ranking rule*
over the layer stack, not a label a caller attached to a path it happened
to concatenate. A layer's scope comes from the layer it was placed in.
Nothing substring-matches a path to guess where it came from -- that was
the bug this replaces, and it mislabelled any bespoke directory whose name
happened to contain a standard layer's shape.

Layers run most general to most specific: ``global -> user -> agent ->
project``. The global layer is the tree root; the user layer is its
``extensions/``, the agent layer is its ``agents/<name>/extensions/``, and
the project layer is anchored beneath an explicitly named project
directory.

The same shape governs Skills: :func:`skills_dir` is the user layer and
:func:`project_skills_dir` is the project layer, anchored the same way and
omitted when no project is named. Skills and Runes are both things a Mvge
loads from a named project, so they answer that question the same way.

The project layer is **omitted, never defaulted**. A caller that passes no
project directory gets no project layer, so the ambient working directory
can never leak into a search path and load code the caller did not name.
A wrong cwd here loads the wrong *code*, which is why this differs from
content resolution: a wrong cwd in a persona chain costs a missing
paragraph, and nothing else.

Every global-layer path honours ``$MVGEOS_GLOBAL_DIR`` (``GLOBAL_DIR_ENV``),
and it is read on every call rather than frozen at import. That is what
relocates the whole layer stack -- global runes, Tomes, auth, approval
state, model cache, audit log -- into one sandbox, and it is what makes an
isolated run possible.
