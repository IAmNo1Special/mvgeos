"""Protocol-facing constants for the ``.agents`` layer scheme.

Four names, all of them contract: the ones that describe the ``.agents``
layer scheme itself. Nothing here *derives* a path -- resolution lives in
:mod:`mvgeos_core.layers`, which is the single place a search path comes
from.

``GLOBAL_DIR_ENV`` and ``PROJECT_RUNE_PATH`` are the protocol-facing names
and must not be renamed; ``Scope`` lives with the ranking rule it feeds, in
``layers``. A feature-scoped environment variable -- the CLI's
``MVGEOS_EXTENSION_DIR``, say -- belongs to the feature that reads it, not
here: this module is the layer scheme, not every literal in the engine.

The same rule keeps the Realm tables out. Which Rune provides a Realm, where
that Realm lives, and what its key is called are facts about Realms, they
need derivation rather than storage, and three packages have to agree on
them -- so they live together in the provider layer, next to the registry
that acts on them. See ADR-0004.

See ADR-0014.

#: resolver in :mod:`mvgeos_core.layers`, on every call.
