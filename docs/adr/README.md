## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Accepted` | The decision stands. |
| `Accepted (amended <date>: …)` | The decision stands; the note says which part moved. |
| `Accepted — mechanism superseded by ADR NNNN` | The decision stands; its implementation was replaced. Read both. |
| `Superseded by ADR …` | The decision is retired. Do not implement it. |

An ADR whose decision is retired but whose reasoning is still useful keeps both
records: the status line points forward, the body keeps the *why*.

## Keeping this index honest

`mvgeos-core/scripts/check_adr_contract.py` asserts that every symbol an ADR
commits to still exists in first-party source, and that every ADR declares a
status. It runs in CI alongside the marketplace contract check.

That check exists because this index drifted silently for 227 commits: ADR-0007
named `TomeLedger`, an in-memory `Index` and `filelock`, none of which existed,
and nothing noticed. Three greps would have caught it. When an ADR's mechanism is
deliberately replaced, amend or supersede the ADR in the same commit that
replaces the code — never let the two drift.
