# ADR 0009: Two-Layer Invariant Scaffolding & Colocated Zero-Config Agent Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Date

## Context

Previously, agents in MvgeOS required manual spell list definitions, programmatic prompt wiring, and hardcoded tool registrations in Python code (e.g. `CodingMvge(spells=[bash, read, write, edit, find, list_files, grep])`). System prompts were tightly coupled with engine scaffolding, making self-modification and dynamic extension cumbersome.

Research across Pi, Google ADK, and modern Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) architectures demonstrated that separating static persona/guidelines from dynamic invariant engine scaffolding significantly improves model adherence, eliminates prompt degradation, and facilitates autonomous self-modification.

## Decision

We adopt the **Two-Layer Invariant Scaffolding Pattern** and **Colocated Zero-Config Agent Architecture**:

### 1. Two-Layer Invariant Scaffolding
- **Layer 1 (Persona & Guidelines)**: Stored in plain markdown files in `system_prompt/` colocated with agent code (`SYSTEM.md`, `GUIDELINES.md`) or resolved via dotagents precedence layers (caller $\rightarrow$ project $\rightarrow$ agent $\rightarrow$ default). If absent, falls back to a neutral 1-sentence Tier-1 anchor (`"You are an AI assistant equipped with spells(tools) to assist your Summoner(user). Be direct, concise, and technical."`).
- **Layer 2 (Invariant ACI Scaffolding)**: Dynamically rendered at prompt compilation time by the engine:
  - `Active spells:` (dynamically populated from coerced callables and rune spells)
  - `Environment:` (OS, architecture, PowerShell syntax & cmdlet guidance on Windows, CWD, current UTC timestamp)
  - `Self-Modification & Customization:` (on-demand pointers to `spells/AGENTS.md`, `skills/AGENTS.md`, `runes/AGENTS.md`, `system_prompt/AGENTS.md`, workspace `AGENTS.md`)
  - `<project_context>` (workspace `AGENTS.md` context injection)
  - `<skills>` (indexed skill catalog)

### 2. Caller-Adjacent Zero-Config Auto-Discovery
- `Mvge(name="...")` uses stack inspection to discover the caller module's directory.
- Auto-loads `.env` located next to the caller.
- Auto-discovers spells from caller-adjacent `spells/` directory using 3-tier discovery precedence:
  1. `__all__` in `spells/__init__.py`
  2. Module filename stem match (`def <stem>(...)` in `<stem>.py`)
  3. Single public function defined within the module
  4. Explicit `SpellDiscoveryError` if ambiguous or missing.
- Auto-resolves caller-adjacent `skills/`, `runes/`, and `system_prompt/` (`SYSTEM.md` and `GUIDELINES.md`).

### 3. Decomposed Modular Spells Subpackage
- Monolithic `spells.py` files are decomposed into a `spells/` subpackage with individual files (`bash.py`, `read.py`, `write.py`, `edit.py`, `find.py`, `list_files.py`, `grep.py`, `_process_tree.py`, `__init__.py`).
- Colocated `AGENTS.md` guides inside `spells/`, `skills/`, and `runes/` establish explicit authoring contracts for autonomous self-modification.

## Consequences

- **Zero Boilerplate**: Defining an agent requires only `root_mvge = Mvge(name="coding_mvge")`.
- **Autonomous Self-Modification**: The agent can inspect and self-modify spells, skills, and runes by reading colocated `AGENTS.md` authoring contracts.
- **Robust Tool Discovery**: Python callables, async functions, and structured `MvgeSpell` objects are transparently coerced and schema-validated.
- **Clean Invariant Separation**: Agent authors focus exclusively on domain guidelines and persona; runtime environment, shell rules, tool schemas, and project context are managed invariantly by the engine.
