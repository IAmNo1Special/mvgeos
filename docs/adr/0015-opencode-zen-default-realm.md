# ADR 0015: OpenCode Zen as the Default Realm

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The default model was `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free`, an OpenRouter
free endpoint. It returned `Upstream error from Nvidia: Service temporarily
overloaded` on three of three clean-machine runs of the task the quickstart
documents (SOM-29). The documented five-minute first run was false, and the
failure was not fixable in prose: it is an engine default pointing at an endpoint
that is at capacity.

Zen's free tier needs **no API key** — a request with no `Authorization` header
returns HTTP 200 with `"cost": "0"`. That is the reason this decision is cheap:
the default Realm resolves and runs for a Summoner who has signed up for nothing.

Two properties of the default decide how a first run behaves, and they are
worth separating because the fix for one is not the fix for the other:

1. **The endpoint has capacity.** Not something the engine can influence.
2. **The model is free.** A paid default means the documented first run asks for
   a card.

OpenCode Zen serves a free tier — `space-bunny-free` among thirteen — on the
standard Chat Completions endpoint, reachable with one key. Its catalog
(`/zen/v1/models`) publishes slash-free bare ids, so a model is addressed
directly with no provider tier to choose.

Three engine facts made adopting it more than a constant change:

- **The engine ships no Realm implementations.** `RealmRegistry` starts empty and
  only a Rune factory ever fills it, so no model resolves on a clean machine until
  a Rune is installed. That was already true; the change makes the default depend
  on it rather than sit beside it.
- **The Rune name in the remedy was hardcoded.** `NoRealmRegisteredError` always
  told the Summoner to install `openrouter-realm`, so a default needing
  `opencode-realm` would have named the wrong Rune — a message that reads as
  actionable and is not.
- **The API key was read from one variable.** `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` alone. Sending
  that to Zen authenticates at the wrong host and then fails every call with a
  message naming the model, so the Summoner is sent to look at the wrong thing.

## Decision

`DEFAULT_MODEL` becomes `opencode/space-bunny-free`. The opencode Realm ships as
the `opencode-realm` Rune in `mvgeos-marketplace` (PR #17), and the CLI offers to
install it when resolution fails — the same bargain the previous default made
with `openrouter-realm`.

Facts about Realms move to `mvgeos-provider/realms.py`, and three consumers read
them from there instead of carrying their own:

- `NoRealmRegisteredError` carries `realm` and `rune_name`, and the CLI prompt and
  the GUI badge read the attribute. The GUI previously recovered the name by
  splitting the message on `"install "`.
- The CLI reads `<REALM>_API_KEY` for the selected model's Realm before falling
  back to `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
- The baseline catalog carries a per-entry Realm, so an entry can name a base URL
  other than OpenRouter's.

The alternative considered was putting the Realm in `mvgeos-provider` rather than
in a Rune, so the default resolves with zero installs. Rejected: it keeps the
charter line that concrete Realms ship as Runes, and the install prompt already
handles the first run. See the decision document on SOM-58 for that trade in
full.

## Contract

Symbols this decision commits to. The Realm tables are the single place the
registry, the CLI and the GUI agree on a Rune name, a base URL and a credential
variable; the derivations must keep producing a usable answer for a Realm that is
not in a table, because they run on the failure path.

<!-- adr-contract: DEFAULT_MODEL, REALM_RUNES, REALM_BASE_URLS, REALM_API_KEY_ENV, REALM_FREE_SUFFIXES, DEFAULT_REALM, realm_for_model_id, rune_for_realm, api_key_env_for_realm, free_suffix_for_realm, no_realm_registered, NoRealmRegisteredError, Model.free -->

## Consequences

- The documented first run depends on a marketplace fetch to install the Rune. A
  fetch failure trades "provider is saturated" for "could not reach the
  marketplace". Both are first-run failures; this one is at least visible.
- `opencode/space-bunny-free`'s context window is **1048576**, measured against
  the live gateway rather than taken from documentation. Zen publishes no context
  length — all 86 entries in `/zen/v1/models` carry only `id`, `object`,
  `created` and `owned_by` — so the value had to be found by sending prompts of
  increasing size until the gateway refused one. A prompt of 1,045,162 tokens
  was accepted; one aiming at 1,055,000 was refused. That brackets 2^20, and
  `should_compact` keeps 16384 tokens of headroom below the recorded value, so
  the recorded figure is the total rather than a ceiling that leaves no room for
  output. An earlier guess of 128000 was eight times too low and would have
  compacted a long session roughly every 128k tokens.
- `DEFAULT_REALM` is a copy of what the catalog says about `DEFAULT_MODEL`, since
  the two are not the same question: for a routed slug the id prefix is the
  *provider*, not the Realm. `test_default_realm_agrees_with_the_shipped_catalog`
  holds the copy honest, and fails if `DEFAULT_MODEL` moves without it.
- `Model.free` now reads a `-free` suffix, scoped to the Realms that use it.
  Scoping is the point: reading it globally would let a model id call a paid model
  free, which is the one mistake a cost guard must not make.
- Contemplation is unavailable on the default. Zen publishes no reasoning
  parameter for this tier, and the standard has no field for it, so the Realm caps
  output tokens instead. Contemplation deltas are still read, so an upstream model
  that thinks out loud lands in the transcript rather than being dropped.
## Verification

Driving the shipped `opencode-realm` against the live gateway, installed the way
the engine installs it and resolved through `RealmRegistry`:

| Fact | Measured |
|---|---|
| Plain channel | stream completes, `PONG` |
| Spells | offered as `tools`; the model casts `bash` with `{"command": "ls -la"}`, stop reason `spellUse` |
| Non-channelled `complete()` | returns text, used for compaction summaries |
| Credential | none required; `cost: 0` |
| Context window | 1,048,576 (1,045,162 accepted, ~1,055,000 refused) |

That live run also found a defect the hermetic suite could not. With no key, both
the Rune and `SSEStreamingRealm` built `Authorization: Bearer ` with nothing
after it, which is an illegal header value — httpx raises `LocalProtocolError`
before the request leaves the process. An `httpx` mock transport accepts the
malformed value, so every test passed. The one Summoner this Realm exists to
serve could not make a single call.

Both the Rune and the engine's client defaults now omit the header when there is
no credential.
